<h1>Grades and Grading Procedure</h1>
<p>Based on the performance in a registered course, each student is awarded a final letter grade at the end of the semester. The letter grades and the corresponding grade points are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Grade</th>
    <th>Grade Points</th>
    <th>Remarks</th>
    <th>Grade</th>
    <th>Grade Points</th>
    <th>Remarks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>S</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Outstanding</td>
    <td>U</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Unsuccessful</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Excellent</td>
    <td>W</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Failure due to insufficient attendance</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Very Good</td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Good</td>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Incomplete</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Average</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Marginal</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Letter grade U or W implies failure in the course.</p>

<h2>Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation</h2>
<p>The Grade Point Average (GPA) in each semester is calculated according to the formula:</p>
<p><strong>GPA = Σ(Ci×GPi)/ΣCi</strong></p>
<p>where Ci and GPi are the number of credits and the grade points obtained in the i-th course taken during the semester, including those in which the student has secured U and W grades.</p>

<p>In the case of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), the credits Ci of all the courses taken in all the semesters until that point in time are considered in the above formula. CGPA at any point in time is calculated based on all the core courses taken by the student until that time (including those in which the student gets a fail grade) and all the elective courses successfully completed by the student until that time (excluding those in which the student gets a fail grade).</p>

<p>The additional courses taken, if any, are awarded grades but not counted towards GPA/CGPA calculations. CGPA to Percentage conversion formula:</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of Marks = (10 × CGPA) - 5</strong></p>
<p>The additional courses audited, if any, are awarded grades but not counted towards GPA/CGPA calculations. The medium of instruction of courses is English.</p>
